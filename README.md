# Basic package

Following the simple tutorial at:
https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-create-and-upload-your-first-python-package-to-pypi/

We use setuptools as a "build system" here. This is declared in `pyproject.toml`. 
Note that you can safely move all configuration settings in `setup.cfg` to `pyproject.toml` if you 
decide to change the build system to flit or poetry, for example.

### Usage

NOTE: You cannot use as follows unless you build the package. See further instructions.

E.g.

    from multiply import multiply_by_three
    from divide import divide_by_three

    multiply_by_three.multiply_by_three(9)
    divide_by_three.divide_by_three(21)

### Generate distribution archives

In the same directory as the `pyproject.toml` file, do

    python -m pip install --upgrade build
    python -m build

Once the process above is completed, a new directory is generated called dist/ with two files in it. 
The .tag.tz file is the source archive and the .whl* file is the built archive. These files 
represent the distribution archives of our Python package which will be uploaded to the Python 
Package Index and installed by pip in the following sections.

### Upload the package

We'll upload the package to PyPI.
If we're just testing things out initially, we can upload to TestPyPI instead.
Then upload to PyPI after.

#### Test PyPI

Make an account at https://test.pypi.org/

After making an API token, we need to upload our distribution archives. To do so, we have to use an 
upload tool to upload our package. The official PyPI upload tool is twine, so let's install twine 
and upload our distribution archives under the dist/ directory.

    python -m pip install --upgrade twine
    python -m twine upload --repository testpypi dist/*
    
#### Actual PyPI

After using `python -m build` to create a `dist/` directory, do

    python -m pip install --upgrade twine
    twine upload dist/*
    
Then install your package with pip like:

    python -m pip install basicpkg-tutorial-drew
    
After this, you can use the package!
